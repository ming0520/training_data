OK. Erm I'm at SS SS AINT SAINT John now, erm doing my AI E AI E{blocks} ES {block}LEVELS. Erm I'm doing FFFFOUR, which is a CH CH CHANGE ause it normally three. Erm I'm doing Maths, IT Art F{x18}I{block} PHYSICS, all of which I can't stand except Art, but that still got loads of work that Ie got to have done by the start of term, which is a bit worrying. Erm Physics IS ISN that bad, but we've got this teacher who so boring. He could ah you just are sort of SSSSSSSEMI-sleeping during every single class, because you honestly can't stay awake. Erm, so you do sort of APROACHCHCH death most of the time, with your heart slowing down and everything, JJJUEST loose conciousness. Erm er MM MATHS is getting quite HAR HARD, cos I mean last year it was all fine, but now we are learning loads of NNNNNN{block} NEW stuff, E EVERY day, and the work load is huge, at the moment, so that's quite W{block} W W W WORRYING, seeing as we got exams coming up. Erm Arts quite fun though, ause it's not really that intense, so erm it's quite good, although I still got to do quite a bit on that, certainly. Erm IT that's, up and down, it C CAN be OK, but it can be really dull, talking about sort of sounds from erm inputs and U OUTPUTS of computers and everything. That bit a bit too technical really. Erm, other than that ss I I IT fine. Erm.
